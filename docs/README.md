# Flutter MCP: Give Your AI Real-Time Flutter Superpowers üöÄ

**A real-time MCP server providing Flutter/Dart documentation and pub.dev package info to AI assistants ‚Äî supports ALL 50,000+ packages on demand.**

Stop fighting with hallucinated widgets and deprecated APIs. Flutter MCP connects your AI assistant to real-time documentation, ensuring the Flutter code it generates actually works.

## The Problem: Your AI is Stuck in 2021

### üò° Without Flutter MCP

```dart
// User: "How do I use Riverpod to watch a future?"

// AI generates (outdated):
final userProvider = FutureProvider((ref) async {
  return fetchUser();
});

// WRONG! Missing autoDispose, family, etc.
```

**Result**: Deprecation warnings, confused debugging, time wasted on Google

</td>
<td width="50%" align="center">

### ‚úÖ With Flutter MCP

```dart
// User: "How do I use @flutter_mcp riverpod to watch a future?"

// AI generates (current v2.5.1):
final userProvider = FutureProvider.autoDispose
  .family<User, String>((ref, userId) async {
    return ref.watch(apiProvider).fetchUser(userId);
});

// Correct, modern, actually works!
```

**Result**: Code works immediately, you ship faster

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation (One Command!)

```bash
# Install and run
pip install flutter-mcp-server
flutter-mcp start
```

That's it! No Redis, no configuration, no complexity. The server is now running with built-in caching.

### Alternative Options

<details>
<summary><strong>üê≥ Docker (Zero Dependencies)</strong></summary>

```bash
# Run with Docker
docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/flutter-mcp/flutter-mcp:latest

# Or use Docker Compose
cd flutter-docs-mcp
docker-compose up
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üéØ Single Executable (Coming Soon)</strong></summary>

```bash
# Download for your platform
curl -L https://github.com/flutter-mcp/releases/latest/flutter-mcp-macos -o flutter-mcp
chmod +x flutter-mcp
./flutter-mcp
```

No Python, no pip, just download and run!

</details>

### Requirements

- **Python 3.10+** (for pip install)
- That's it! Built-in SQLite caching means no external dependencies

### 2. Add to Your AI Assistant

<details open>
<summary><strong>Claude Desktop</strong></summary>

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flutter-mcp": {
      "command": "flutter-mcp",
      "args": ["start"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code (claude.ai/code)</strong></summary>

Claude Code automatically manages MCP servers. Just install the package:

```bash
pip install flutter-mcp-server
```

Claude Code will detect and use the server automatically when you mention Flutter/Dart packages.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cursor / Windsurf</strong></summary>

In Settings ‚Üí MCP Servers, add:

```json
{
  "flutter-mcp": {
    "command": "flutter-mcp",
    "args": ["start"]
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>VS Code + Continue</strong></summary>

In your `.continuerc.json`:

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "provider": "claude",
      "mcp_servers": {
        "flutter-mcp": {
          "command": "flutter-mcp",
          "args": ["start"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

### 3. Start the Server (Optional for Claude Desktop)

<details>
<summary>If using standalone mode or testing</summary>

```bash
# Run in foreground (see logs)
flutter-mcp start

# Run in background
flutter-mcp start --daemon

# Check status
flutter-mcp status
```

Note: When configured in Claude Desktop, the server starts automatically.

</details>

### 3. Use It!

Mention any Flutter/Dart package in your prompts, and Flutter MCP will automatically provide real-time documentation:

```
"How do I implement infinite scroll with infinite_scroll_pagination?"
"Show me dio interceptors for auth tokens"
"What's the difference between bloc and riverpod?"
```

üí° **Pro tip**: For explicit package documentation, use `@flutter_mcp package_name`:

```
"Explain @flutter_mcp freezed code generation"
"Show me all @flutter_mcp get_it service locator patterns"
```

## üìö Available Tools

Flutter MCP provides 5 powerful tools for AI assistants:

### 1. `get_flutter_docs`

Fetches official Flutter/Dart API documentation.

```json
{
  "tool": "get_flutter_docs",
  "arguments": {
    "class_name": "Container",
    "library": "widgets"
  }
}
```

### 2. `get_pub_package_info`

Gets complete package information including README from pub.dev.

```json
{
  "tool": "get_pub_package_info",
  "arguments": {
    "package_name": "provider"
  }
}
```

### 3. `search_flutter_docs`

Intelligently searches across Flutter/Dart documentation.

```json
{
  "tool": "search_flutter_docs",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "material.AppBar"
  }
}
```

### 4. `process_flutter_mentions`

Processes `@flutter_mcp` mentions in text for context injection.

```json
{
  "tool": "process_flutter_mentions",
  "arguments": {
    "text": "I need help with @flutter_mcp riverpod state management"
  }
}
```

### 5. `health_check`

Monitors the health of all scrapers and services.

```json
{
  "tool": "health_check",
  "arguments": {}
}
```

## üéØ Features

- **üì¶ Real-Time Documentation**: Fetches the latest docs for any pub.dev package on-demand
- **üöÄ Zero Configuration**: Automatically detects packages from your `pubspec.yaml`
- **‚ö° Lightning Fast**: Intelligent caching means instant responses after first fetch
- **üîí 100% Private**: Runs locally - your code never leaves your machine
- **üé® Smart Context**: Provides constructors, methods, examples, and migration guides
- **‚ôæÔ∏è Unlimited Packages**: Works with all 50,000+ packages on pub.dev

## üí° How It Works

Flutter MCP is a local MCP server (think of it as a "RAG sidecar" for Flutter) built on the battle-tested Python MCP SDK. It enhances your AI with real-time documentation:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Your Prompt] --> B[AI Assistant]
    B --> C{Flutter/Dart Content?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Query Flutter MCP]
    D --> E[Check Local Cache]
    E -->|Hit| F[Return Cached Docs]
    E -->|Miss| G[Fetch from pub.dev]
    G --> H[Process & Cache]
    H --> F
    F --> I[Enhanced Context]
    I --> J[AI Generates Accurate Code]
    C -->|No| J
```

### The Magic Behind the Scenes

1. **MCP Integration**: Your AI assistant automatically detects when you're asking about Flutter/Dart packages
2. **Smart Detection**: No special syntax required - just mention package names naturally
3. **Lightning Cache**: First request fetches from pub.dev (1-2 seconds), subsequent requests are instant
4. **Context Injection**: Documentation is seamlessly added to your AI's knowledge before it responds
5. **Privacy First**: Everything runs locally - your code and queries never leave your machine

### Performance Notes

- ‚ö° **First Query**: 1-2 seconds (fetching from pub.dev)
- üöÄ **Cached Queries**: <50ms (from local SQLite cache)
- üíæ **Cache Duration**: 24 hours for API docs, 12 hours for packages
- üßπ **Auto-Cleanup**: Expired entries cleaned on access

### Error Handling

If documentation isn't available or a fetch fails, Flutter MCP gracefully informs your AI, preventing it from generating incorrect or hallucinated code based on missing information. Your AI will let you know it couldn't find the docs rather than guessing.

## üìä What Gets Indexed

When you request a package, Flutter MCP extracts:

- ‚úÖ **API Documentation**: Classes, methods, properties with full signatures
- ‚úÖ **Constructors**: All parameters, named arguments, defaults
- ‚úÖ **Code Examples**: From official docs and README files
- ‚úÖ **Migration Guides**: Breaking changes and upgrade paths
- ‚úÖ **Package Metadata**: Dependencies, platform support, versions

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

<details>
<summary><strong>Pre-cache Common Packages</strong></summary>

Speed up your workflow by pre-caching frequently used packages:

```bash
flutter-mcp cache add provider riverpod bloc dio freezed
```

</details>

```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Docker Deployment</strong></summary>
