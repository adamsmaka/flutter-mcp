# Flutter MCP Project Summary

## Vision
Create the Context7 of Flutter - an MCP server that gives AI assistants real-time access to Flutter/Dart documentation, positioning it as the essential tool for Flutter developers using Claude, Cursor, or Windsurf.

## Key Innovation: On-Demand Package Support
Instead of pre-indexing 35,000+ packages, we use an on-demand model:
- User requests `@flutter_mcp provider`
- System fetches, processes, and caches package docs in ~30 seconds
- Future requests are served instantly from cache

## Technical Architecture
- **Core**: Python FastMCP with Redis caching
- **Fetching**: On-demand from api.flutter.dev, pub.dev API
- **Processing**: HTML → Clean Markdown with semantic chunking
- **Activation**: `@flutter_mcp package_name` in prompts

## Marketing Strategy

### Positioning
"The first AI companion that supports ANY pub.dev package on-demand"

### Key Messages
1. **End the State Management Wars** - Impartial expert on all approaches
2. **Beyond the README** - Full source analysis, not just documentation
3. **Always Current** - Real-time fetching, never outdated

### Launch Plan
- **Platform**: r/FlutterDev "Show-off Saturday"
- **Demo**: LLM failing → add @flutter_mcp → perfect answer
- **Engagement**: Live package request fulfillment during launch
- **Influencers**: Reach out to top Flutter YouTubers

### Viral Tactics
- Developer testimonials with specific problems solved
- "Powered by @flutter_mcp" badges
- Community-generated before/after demos
- Flutter package maintainer partnerships

## Success Metrics
- 1,000+ GitHub stars in first month
- 100+ packages indexed in first week
- 50%+ cache hit rate after first month
- 10+ developer testimonials
- Coverage in Flutter Weekly

## Timeline
- **MVP (4 hours)**: Basic server with Flutter API docs
- **Week 1**: Add pub.dev support, search, polish
- **Week 2**: Launch preparation and marketing push
- **Launch Week**: Coordinated multi-platform release

## Files Created
1. `project-tasks.csv` - 60 detailed tasks with priorities
2. `ingestion-strategy.md` - What content to extract from packages
3. `context7-marketing-analysis.md` - Marketing tactics analysis

The project is designed to solve a real problem (outdated AI knowledge of Flutter) with a simple solution (@flutter_mcp activation) that can be built quickly and marketed effectively to the Flutter community.
